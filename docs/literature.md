# Literature Alignment Notes

This document maps core mechanics in `gsocialsim` to established findings in social
and political psychology. It is intentionally concise and focuses on the specific
mechanisms implemented in code.

## Model-to-Literature Mapping (Selected)

- **Motivated reasoning / identity protection** -> identity threat gating, backfire
  on hostile opposing content, and self-reinforcement in consolidation.
- **Confirmation bias** -> aligned content increases confidence more than opposing content.
- **Source credibility & trust** -> influence strength scales by trust and credibility.
- **Homophily & tie strength** -> trust updates rise with alignment and decay with threat.
- **Intergroup contact** -> physical (in‑person) interactions boost trust and
  can support cross‑cutting influence.
- **Affective polarization** -> politically salient topics increase identity threat
  and resistance when content is opposed.
- **Backfire evidence is mixed** -> backfire is conditional (requires high threat),
  leaving open non-hostile change paths.
- **Primal brain activation (SalesBrain)** -> optional primal trigger fields increase
  persuasion when present (abstracted to a bounded multiplier).
